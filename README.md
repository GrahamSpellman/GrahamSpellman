# Hello! :wave:

I'm Graham, a senior in college. If you're looking at this, you're either a professor, another student, or Vinny.
It's good to have you here, feel free to look around. I just moved in, so I'm still making myself at home :house_with_garden:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on $\downarrow$: A small functional library for calibration and analysis of photoluminescence data from raree-earths.
